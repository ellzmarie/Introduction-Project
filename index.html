      <p>In these strange times during a pandemic, I currently reside in Roseville, California. </p>
      
      <p>As a former pro singer and currently a Support Lead, I want to level up in my career as a Software Engineer for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> I love to solve problems</li>
        <li> I enjoy the start-up environment and being a part of a constantly evolving industry</li>
        <li> My daughter wants to build her own app and a robot when she grows up â€” I want to help guide her through this</li>
      </ul>

  <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
  <p>I've been a professional singer since I was kid and all through college. While in college, I discovered that I'm a life-long learner and learning doesn't stop after you earn a shiny degree.</p> 
    
  <p>Meanwhile, I had worked at start-ups for the past six-ish years in the Support / Success field. As someone who was the bridge between customers and my colleagues, I've gained lots of skills and knowledge working cross-functionally across all the different teams. I've mostly enjoyed working closely with the engineering team and was always fascinated with their super powers to problem solve. I finally found the courage to learn and pursue software development. I thought that it would be a great opportunity for me to invest in myself and take this leap at Thinkful.</p>
