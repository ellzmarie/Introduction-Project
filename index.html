<!-- 3 paragraphs about me-->
      <p>In these strange times during a pandemic, I currently reside in Roseville, California. </p>
      
      <p>As a former pro singer and currently a Support Lead at School of Motion, I want to level up in my career as a Software Engineer for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> I love to solve problems</li>
        <li> I enjoy the start-up environment and being a part of a constantly evolving industry</li>
        <li> My daughter wants to build her own app and a robot when she grows up — I want to help guide her through this</li>
      </ul>

  <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
  <p>I've been a professional singer since I was a kid and all through college. While in college and being involved in music projects, I was offered a role at a startup. Since then, I've worked at startups for the past six and a half years in the Support / Success field. </p>      
  
  <p>As someone who has been the bridge between customers and team members, I've gained lots of skills and knowledge working cross-functionally across different teams at startups. I truly enjoy collaborating with colleagues and building efficient processes to provide visibility of customer problems. What I've found fascinating is working closely with engineers and watch them solve problems. So much that it has inspired me to learn and eventually contribute to the team in that same way.</p>      
    
  <p>Through the years, I've discovered that as a life-long learner, learning doesn't stop after you've earned a shiny degree. This is why I've finally found the courage to leap and further my learning in programming. There's never a right or wrong time to invest in yourself — I'm excited to dive in. Once I've completed this program, I can ensure that I will efficiently help my daughter create an app and build her "life size" robot, and I will also pay it forward by helping those in underserved communities learn, as well.</p>
