<!-- 3 paragraphs about me-->
      <p>In these strange times during a pandemic, I currently reside in Roseville, California. </p>
      
      <p>As a former pro singer and currently a Support Lead, I want to level up in my career as a Software Engineer for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> I love to solve problems</li>
        <li> I enjoy the start-up environment and being a part of a constantly evolving industry</li>
        <li> My daughter wants to build her own app and a robot when she grows up — I want to help guide her through this</li>
      </ul>

  <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
  <p>I've been a professional singer since I was kid and all through college. While in college, I was offered a role at a startup and since then, I've been working at startups for the past six and a half years in the Support / Success field. </p>       
  
  <p>As someone who has been the bridge between customers and team members, I've gained lots of skills and knowledge working cross-functionally across different teams at startups. I truly enjoy collaborating with colleagues and building efficient processes to provide visibility of customer problems. What I  find most fascinating is working closely with engineers and watching them solve problems. So much that it has inspired me to further contribute to the team in that same way.</p>       
  
  <p>Through the years, I've discovered that as a life-long learner, learning doesn't stop after you've earned a shiny degree. This is why I've finally found the courage to take a step forward to switching careers as a software engineer. There's never a right or wrong time to invest in yourself and am really excited to take this leap at Thinkful. Once I've completed this program, my goal to helping my daughter is more achievable and will pay it forward by helping others learn, as well.</p>
